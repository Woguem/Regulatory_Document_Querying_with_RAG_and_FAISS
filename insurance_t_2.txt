European Insurance Overview
The Annual European Insurance Overview is published by EIOPA as an extension of its statistical services in order to provide an easy-to-use and accessible overview of the European insurance sector. The report is based on annually reported Solvency II information. This ensures that the data has a high coverage in all countries and is reported in a consistent manner across the EEA.

Capital add-ons
EIOPA is requested to report annually to EU institutions (i.e. European Parliament, the Council and the Commission) the capital add-ons to insurance and reinsurance undertakings or groups by National Competent Authorities, following their supervisory review process, in accordance with Article 52 of the Solvency II Directive.

Capital add-ons reported are those imposed pursuant to the Article 37 of Solvency II Directive and Articles 276 - 287 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35. 

EIOPA has prepared the statistical table on the use of capital add-ons in the European Economic Area (EEA) based on 2023 year-end Solvency II data as reported by the undertakings and insurance groups via the Solvency II Quantitative Reporting Templates (QRTs). 

The statistical update consists of a Dashboard and an Excel file containing all the available data.
